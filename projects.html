                    <h2>more thAt I</h2>
                    <p>“more thAn I” is a project aimed at creating experiences that encourage people to engage with more-than-human intelligences in a collaborative way. The installation investigates potentialities of diversifying narratives (about presents, pasts and futures) by initiating a collective storytelling that transcends into a ‘more-than-human’ space.</p> 
                    <p>it is a collaborative storytelling in which an AI- Language Model asks questions while paticipants watch their answers being weaved into a continuous story and projected in real time. Their input merges with the one from the participant beforer and the ones that come after, forming a fascinating plot.</p>
                    <p>the aim is to create a space for critical engagement with AI-tools and the (social) structures that underlie human-machine interactions and outcomes. What happens if we mix a ‘human collective’ and an ‘artificial’ intelligence? Is it an actual ‘mix’?</p>

                    <h2>50/50 refuge</h2>
                    <p>here I investigate the concept of borders and their impact on society.</p>
                    <p>in 2021, on 10 May, a military strike kills seven civilians. In the aftermath, another 119 people are killed over a dispute over land, and the right to walk on the streets. Shocked by the unpredictability and spontaneity of these events, I am questioning the made-up lines governments draw on ground and that cause fear and death in so many spaces. This cube floating in the air, blowing with the wind wherever it blows, imagines a safe space where there is no room for fear of soil-related consequences.</p>
                    <p>I explore the relationship between <i>solids</i> and <i>air</i>, emphasizing that there can be no solids without spaces to fill and no visibility of air and space without solids to give them scale. The piece invites the viewer to consider the role of air as a refuge, as the lighter and potentially more neutral element in contrast to the heavy and divisive nature of frontiers drawn on the ground.</p>

                    <h2>Museum of Colonialisation (MOC)</h2>
                    <p>we are a group of multidisciplinary designers that came together with the goal of developing interventions that focus on non-western- centric futures. The project is based on the thought that the whole world is a museum of colonialization, you just don’t see it. We have created artifacts and prototypes that challenge colonialism and capitalistic structures while promoting the recognition of colonization and its remaining consequence in our societies.</p>
                    <p>the museum started as an interactive machine that works just like a gumball dispenser. Visitors can click the “YES” button, as in “I agree to visit the museum”, to receive a ball that contains a sticker with a “fun fact” about a colonial criminal who has been celebrated in some way around Barcelona.</p>
                    <p>we then created a stamp-button that leaves an imprint on any chosen surface when pressed. As the user pushes the button, a speaker is activated, declaring “That’s so colonial”, this draws attention to the guerrilla act being performed. Meanwhile, the user’s GPS location is automatically added to an online MOC-Map. The image stamped is a QR code that directly links to that map, where users can see their pinned location and those of all previous users.</p>
                    <p>the most recent project is a “free walking tour” in Barcelona that aims to foster caring dialogues around the colonial history of European cities and connect it to our present realities. we aim to provide context and background by bringing attention to the impacts of (current) colonialist structures and its impacts. With that we hope to make visitors question their assumptions.</p>

                    <h2>UP 2 US</h2>
                    <p>this project was developed as part of the Circular Cities Challenge by the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) and FabLab Barcelona. Our team of four worked to find an answer to the challenge faced by the energy sector in its attempt to transition to renewable energy sources: How to deal with the time mismatch between energy consumption and energy production?</p>
                    <p>if energy from renewable sources is high during sunny or windy hours and no one uses it, we leave it unused (waste it?), while if consumption exceeds energy production from renewable sources at night, when the sun is no longer shining and the wind has calmed down, we make up the deficit with energy from non-renewable sources and batteries. Therefore, to fully transition to renewable energy sources, an awareness of the availability and physicality of energy is required.</p>
                    <p>UP2US aims to address the problem of unused hours at a community level. An installation in public space makes people aware of the energy mismatch. Corresponding colours and an accompanying digital interface translate data about the current availability of energy. Communities can independently adjust their behaviour to reduce pressure on the energy grid during peak hours and work towards a more balanced energy system that can be supported by renewable energy sources.</p>

                    <h2>storytelling workshops: speculative narration</h2>
                    <p>along three overarching concepts related to transitioning: unfamiliarise, grief, and rebirth, the goal of these workshop-series is to facilitate space for imagining alternative realities. Participants are encouraged to engage with unfamiliar positions, process feelings of grief, and explore ideas for new beginnings. We aim to go beyond our individual selves but rather engage with more than us (the facilitators Myrto and me), (and maybe even ‘more-than-human’ actants) to inspire to new ways of thinking and being in the world.</p>
                    <p>one of the topics we chose for a workshop was “Transition in the Educational System: From In-person to Hybrid Forms of Learning and Teaching.” Here we explore the challenges and opportunities presented by this transition, and imagine alternative ways of approaching education in the future.</p>
                    <p>the output of these workshops is the input for an experimentation with Artificial Intelligence creativity and the merging between human and more-than- human imagination. We fed parts of the outcome into Language models and Visualisation models.</p>

                    <h2>ghost machine</h2>
                    <p>the project involved repurposing materials from two old computers and designing something new. The screens, speakers, and LEDs are integrated with an Arduino to create a machine that can detect the presence of people (sensitive to change in light intensity) and respond with sound and light.</p>
                    <p>the result is an installation in which a storytelling blurs the lines between the seen and unseen. In the story, the flowers provide a way to engage with the hidden energies in our surroundings, to ghosts.</p>
                    <p><i>this ghost machine senses the activity that are not visual to the human eye. A polarized glove allows its wearer to be the channel of energies roaming around freely in air and non-air.

                    <h2>receptor pieces</h2>
                    <p>anxiety, depression, and burn-outs are topics to daily conversations in my mid-twenties social circles. I talked to friends about their tricks to feel comfortable and secure in difficult situations. During these conversations, I wrote down their secret recipes in their own words. </p>
                    <p>I transformed a large tapestry on which I had previously embroidered a personal story into a book. Using the sublimation printing technique, I printed their memories onto my story, creating a merging of experiences and sentiments between myself and my friends. </p> 
                    <p>this recipe book is not intended to be be re-cooked, nor used as a manual for resolving mental health issues, but rather a tactile and sensory experience. Rifling through its soft pages aims to share loneliness’ and evoke senses of comfort and familiarities.</p>

                    <p>these studies are a result of four-hour drawing sessions in which an object (the pepper) or a photo (the whale) were starting point to visual analysis. I tried to extract the very essence from my object of study. These exercises taught me to look more closely, to choose importance’s over banalities, to look at what I see without a filter.</p>

                    <p>for the graduation show 2022 of the <i>Gerrit Rietveld Academie</i> in Amsterdam, I was part of the seven- person team that designed the outdoor space in which casual encounters as well as formal dines, and speeches would take place. We collaborated with the Amsterdam based company <i>Dutch Steigers</i> who were also responsible for MVRDV’s “The Podium” (2022). Our construction was supposed to be in July of that year but because of finantial reasons the project could not be realized in the end and remained a (pretty realistic) speculation.</p>

                    <h2>safe places</h2>
                    <p>in 2016, I went to Ecuador to help build a school in Aiguas Frias in the Atacames region, which is very affected by earthquakes and had recently experienced the effects of a 7.9 magnitude quake. I stayed with a host family who took care of a large wooden house. The family consists of eight people of almost all ages. They experienced the tremors and soon after they became afraid of what it means to live far from the ground. They moved into the chicken shed, which was no bigger than a few square metres. I slept in the big house alone. The white European privileged girl could not to squeeze in with the eight people and their chickens on the dirty floor. I felt scared there on my own.</p>
                    <p>in this sequence of images, models, collages and animations, I am trying to reconstruct and simulate the feeling the tremors must have left them with. I use my own memories of staying there, the images I have from that time and place and related footage I get from open-source.</p>

                    <h2>reimagining the campus</h2>
                    <p>the outdoor-campus of the <i>Gerrit Rietveld Academie</i> for Arts and Crafts is a vibrant space where students and faculty members come together. In its middle stands a pavilion (also designed by Gerrit Rietveld), which was originally intended to serve as a sculpting workshop. However, over the years, it has been repurposed as a student-run exhibition place. Despite its central location, the pavilion lacks adequate infrastructure to facilitate interaction and relaxation.</p>
                    <p>in order to identify the needs and opportunities for improvement, I conducted an ethnographic study of the pavilion on campus. This research revealed that while the pavilion is successfully used as an exhibition space, the campus generally lacks infrastructures and places for meeting and sharing. Students and teachers find it difficult to come together and find inspiration in exchange, which results in a disjointed and transient atmosphere in the yard of the academy.</p>
                    <p>the aim of this project is to propose a redesign for the infrastructure of the pavilion to increase its visibility and attraction as well as to create a space that encourages collaboration and pausing. My proposal maintains the exhibition space as it is while introducing new elements inspired by Gerrit Rietveld’s vision of interaction and co-creation.</p>
